sassy sassy buttons
===================

This is a fork of jhardy/Sassy-Buttons with the Compass dependencies removed for use in vanilla SCSS projects.

Pretty much the only reason you'd want to use this is if you've inherited an old project that used compass and jhardy/Sassy-Buttons, AND you're too lazy to code some new buttons.
